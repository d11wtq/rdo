    # implementation is done in C, since the scanning routine is
    # considerably faster.

    # Each value in params is processed according to its type:
    #
    #   - NilClass, Fixnum, Float, inserted as literals (NULL or a number)

    #   - All other objects converted to String then processed as a String
